# IPL Ball-by-Ball Data Analysis

## Project Objective
Analyze IPL ball-by-ball data to extract insights related to batter performance, bowling effectiveness, and venue-based match dynamics.

## Dataset
- IPL Matches dataset
- IPL Ball-by-Ball deliveries dataset

## Key Questions Addressed
- Who are the most consistent batters in IPL history?
- Which bowlers are most effective in death overs?
- How do venues influence scoring patterns?
- Does winning the toss impact match outcomes?

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Developed a custom consistency index combining batting average and strike rate.
- Identified powerplay specialists and death-over bowlers using ball-level data.
- Highlighted venue-specific scoring trends and toss impact.
- Demonstrated the importance of contextual analysis over raw statistics.
